Outside of philosophy
================================

While philosophy is really wonderful, I have a few other passions and projects that keep me busy. 

*Badlands: A Politics & Philosophy Podcast*

I'm one of the collaborators on this podcast. We try to bring philosophical nuance to political discussions. We've been working on a series on money in politics and have recorded a number of roundtable discussions about issues such as political compromise, optics in politics, and what future generations might blame us for. We plan to launch mid-summer 2018.

*Fiction*

I'm an avid reader, especially of science fiction. Some of my favorite writers are Douglas Adams, Ursula K. LeGuin, Octavia Butler, and Cixin Liu. I'm planning to read all of Terry Pratchett's *Discworld* novels --- at this point I'm about 10% there. I'm also lately revisiting some old favorites; currently I'm reading (and loving) *Farenheit 451.*

*Advocating for internet privacy*

Internet privacy -- the ability to browse and speak with anonymity (if we so choose), without having your personal data tracked and stored -- is a big passion of mine. In my ideal world, internet privacy wouldn't be something you have to try and maintain; it would be the default online experience. I support and donate to the [Electronic Fronteir Foundation](https://eff.org) to try to build a free, open, and anonymous internet. I'm also working on a project, *Why We Need Privacy*, which I hope will serve as an accessible philosophical defense of internet privacy.
