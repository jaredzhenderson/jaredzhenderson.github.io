I am fourth-year graduate student at the [University of Connecticut](https://philosophy.uconn.edu), a member of the [Logic Group.](https://logic.uconn.edu), and a research assistant at the [University of Connecticut Humanities Institute](https://humanities.uconn.edu/). I plan to defend my dissertation, *Degrees and Deflationism*, in the coming spring semester.  You can read about papers I have published or submitted for publication [here](papers). For information about my background, see [my CV](Academic_CV.pdf).

In June I will be joining [Cycorp](https://cyc.com) as an ontological engineer. 

My Erdos number is 4. [Me <- Jc Beall <- John Burgess <- R.D. Maudlin]
