I am fourth-year graduate student at the [University of Connecticut](https://philosophy.uconn.edu) and a member of the [Logic Group.](https://logic.uconn.edu)

Broadly speaking, my interests are in philosophical logic, philosophy of language, and metaphysics. My dissertation, which I am writing under the direction of Keith Simmons, Stewart Shapiro, Michael Lynch, and Magdalena Kaufmann, explores the connections between theories of truth -- including theories of the truth predicate and the metaphysics of truth -- and linguistic semantic theories. 

My default attitude toward philosophical issues is a pragmatic one: I first look at how we use a word or concept, then I try to give a theory of it. That's the methodology employed in my dissertation. I take this pragmatic methodology to lead to a sort of pluralism about semantic concepts. 

I'm also interested in semantics, such as the semantics of generics and the role of events in theories, social epistemology, and skepticism. 

I have links to and descriptions of papers (both published and in progress) [here](papers), descriptions of my teaching style and previous courses [here](teach), and a description of some of my non-philosophical interests and hobbies [here](hobbies). My CV can be found [here](cv.pdf).
