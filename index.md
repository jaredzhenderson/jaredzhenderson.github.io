I am an ontologist at [Cycorp](https://cyc.com) in Austin, TX.

I received my PhD in Philosophy from the [University of Connecticut](https://philosophy.uconn.edu) in Spring of 2019. My dissertation was on theories of truth, with a lot of overlap in linguistics. While at UConn I was a member of the [Logic Group](https://logic.uconn.edu) and a research assistant at the [University of Connecticut Humanities Institute.](https://humanities.uconn.edu/)

You can read about papers I have published or submitted for publication [here](papers). For information about my academic background, see [my CV](Academic_CV.pdf).

My Erdos number is 4. [Me <- Jc Beall <- John Burgess <- R.D. Maudlin]
