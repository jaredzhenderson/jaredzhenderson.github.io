I am fourth-year graduate student at the [University of Connecticut](https://philosophy.uconn.edu) and a member of the [Logic Group.](https://logic.uconn.edu) This fall I joined the [University of Connecticut Humanities Institute](https://humanities.uconn.edu/) as a graduate assistant.

The majority of my research lies at the intersections of philosophical logic, philosophy of language, and metaphysics. Most of my research is on the nature and uses of semantic concepts, and especially truth. My dissertation is on theories of truth, and in particular *deflationary* and *degree-theoretic* conceptions of truth. These issue are the subject of the bulk of [my writing](papers).

I'm also generally interested in semantics, in particular the semantics of generics and the role of events in semantic theories, social epistemology, and skepticism. 

While at UConn, I've [taught several courses](teach). I enjoy experimenting with pedagogy. I've also served as a research assistant for [Jc Beall](http://www.entailments.net), with whom I've collaborated on a project in logic and analytic theory. I'm currently a research assistant for [Keith Simmons](https://www.keithegsimmons.com/); my task is to survey contemporary defenses of correspondence theories of truth.
