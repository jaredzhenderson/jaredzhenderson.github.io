I am fourth-year graduate student at the [University of Connecticut](https://philosophy.uconn.edu) and a member of the [Logic Group.](https://logic.uconn.edu) This fall I joined the [University of Connecticut Humanities Institute](https://humanities.uconn.edu/) as a graduate assistant. In June, after defending my dissertation, I will be joining [Cycorp](https://cyc.com) as an ontological engineer.
