I am an ontologist at [Cycorp](https://cyc.com) in Austin, TX. I'm interested in ontologies, knowledge graphs, and natural language processing. I want machines to be able to read and understand text just like a human being.

In a previous life, I was a philosopher. I received my PhD in Philosophy from the [University of Connecticut](https://philosophy.uconn.edu) in 2019. My dissertation was on theories of truth, with a lot of overlap in linguistics. While at UConn I was a member of the [Logic Group](https://logic.uconn.edu).

You can read about papers I have published or submitted for publication [here](papers). For information about my academic background, see [my CV](henderson_resume.pdf).
