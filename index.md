I received my PhD in Philosophy from the [University of Connecticut](https://philosophy.uconn.edu) in Spring of 2019. While at UConn I was a member of the [Logic Group.](https://logic.uconn.edu) and a research assistant at the [University of Connecticut Humanities Institute.](https://humanities.uconn.edu/)
 
In June I will be joining [Cycorp](https://cyc.com) as an ontological engineer. 

You can read about papers I have published or submitted for publication [here](papers). For information about my background, see [my CV](Academic_CV.pdf).
