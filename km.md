Most content we encounter -- in a book, on the web, etc.-- is *structured.* The problem is that it is almost all structured in the wrong way. 

More companies are realizing that content has to be structured well in order to be accessible and reusable. There are a number of strategies for structuring content (for instance: taxonomies, ontologies, and knowledge graphs). We could use the heading 'knowledge management' for these sorts of strategies. What many people don't recognize is that *personal* knowledge also benefits from being structured.

The big problem is figuring out how you want to structure your knowledge. 

I am a big fan of solutions like Roam Research and Obsidian. Both have the power of bidirectional linking, the ability to link concepts as they appear in different parts of a graph or file structure. Because it allows for block-level linking -- which is smore fine-grained than page-level linking -- I have to come to really appreciate Roam.

[I am starting a public graph on Roam.](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/jared-public) Over the next several months I will be curating content from my personal graphs and making my knowledge grow. I'll be primarily posting notes on books and articles.
